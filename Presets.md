# Presets

A way to use Cowboy Untamed without storing any configuration persistantly in your bike.
This functionality can only be used on Android.

## Introduction

Some Cowboys out there are not comfortable with storing/altering their motor controller settings. For those Cowboys and those whom want to use an alternative setting once a while.
Presets can be a solution. 

The configuration is done through the main Cowboy Untamed app via menu *Quick Launch Presets*. You have to be connected to your bike, even for configuring the presets. Some values are internally specific per version of each Cowboy bike. Therfore I need to fetch them tot calculate the correct value.

Presets are started through the second app icon.
