# Cowboy Customization
In this document I will try to collect special customizations I made to my Cowboy bike. I also will try to supply information, photo's and files so you make the modifications yourself.

It won't be complete tutorials, you need to use your own skills and brains, but it will be doable.
Also note that I own a **Cowboy V1+**, not everything is the same on all bike models.

## New headlight design
About half a year ago I created a new lens/lamp cover for my Cowboy, it increased the light quite a bit. But now, when darker days are joining near, it's still not effective enough to my likings. So I developed *V2*.

**Note:** I know it's not as beautifull as the original cover, but I personally like this better then adding a seperate light.

### The materials used
- [7 lenzes from Ali Express](https://a.aliexpress.com/_uIxFhM)
- Transparent PET & white ABS 3D print filament

### The 3D print files
- [3D print files](https://github.com/Imaginous/Cowboy_Untamed/files/7446418/Printing.zip)


### Basic instructions
You have to print the cover part with a multi material 3D printer to fuse the ABS and PET parts together. I use a variable layer height of 0.2mm for the first layer, then 0.1mm for layer 2-6, and the rest again on 0.2mm. I use a Prusa 3D printer MII-Multi material V1.

Print the *bike reflector lens* with white ABS and a few pieces of doublesided foam tape underneath to stick it to the PCB later.

After printing I strengthen the clips by adding some super glue onto it. I use super glue which comes with a brush.
You can push in the lenzes, if you want you can ad a very small drop of super glue on the left and right side of the lens.

**NOTE: Removing the headlight can be done destructive and non destructive. I used the destructive way.**
To remove the headlight the proper way you need to remove the entire front fork. As soon as you have taken it out you can push out two white clips. By doing so the entire headlight will pop out.

**The destruvtive way** is way easier, but you will break the clips of the original cover. This might be a problem if you want to put the bike back in it's original state. You can always buy a new headlight at Cowboy.
The trick is to put doublesided tape on the headlight (clean it first). Then add a large flat piece of metal (or wood) and pull straight out... the clips will break and you have the front light cover stuck to your piece of metal. Try to get the rest of the clips out so they won't fall into your steering tube. Now push the upper part into the bike and lift the lower part out. Slide it a bit down and pinch the two upper clips with your fingers. You can now pull the light slightly towards you. Not very far, because the cable is rather short.

Now stick the reflector part to the PCB (note the notches). Now clip on your new cover with the lenzes in place (if you don't want to glue them stick them in place with a bit of tape on the front side, the lenzes will be snugg after it's clipped in place. you can then remove the tape).

**Test the light** and then place the unit back into the bike, first make sure the bottom bit is in as far as possible, then slowly push in the top part.
